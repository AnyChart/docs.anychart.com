# Mosaic Chart

* [Overview](#overview)

## Overview

Mosaic chart is pretty much the same as the [basic Mekko chart](Mekko_Chart) but with one important difference: Y scale is ordinal and contains series names instead of numbers.

## Quick Start

### Appearance

### Labels

[Labels](../Common_Settings/Labels) are text or image elements that can be placed anywhere on any chart (you can enable them on a whole series or in a single point). For text labels, font settings and [text formatters](../Common_Settings/Text_Formatters) are available.

### Tooltips

A [Tooltip](../Common_Settings/Tooltip) is a text box displayed when a point on a chart is hovered. There is a number of visual and other settings available: for example, you can edit the text by using font settings and [text formatters](../Common_Settings/Text_Formatters), change the style of background, adjust the position of a tooltip, and so on.

### Vertical Mosaic Chart

Most types of series in AnyChart can be drawn both in horizontal and vertical orientation: [Vertical Charts (Overview)](Vertical/Overview).
