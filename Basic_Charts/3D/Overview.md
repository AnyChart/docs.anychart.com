## Overview

AnyChart supports 3D versions of the following chart types: Area, Bar, Column, and Pie. Some modifications of these types can be also drawn in 3D – see the [Supported Types](#supported_types) section.

This article explains how to create and configure 3D charts.

## Quick Start

To create a 3D chart, use one of the following chart constructors:
* {api:anychart#area3d}anychart.area3d(){api}
* {api:anychart#bar3d}anychart.bar3d(){api}
* {api:anychart#column3d}anychart.column3d(){api}
* {api:anychart#pie3d}anychart.pie3d(){api}

You can either pass your data to the chart constructor or create a series, using one of these methods:
* {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian#area}area(){api}
* {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian#bar}bar(){api}
* {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian#column}column(){api}

That is how it looks like:

```
// create a data set
var data = anychart.data.set([
  ["January", 10000],
  ["February", 12000],
  ["March", 18000],
  ["April", 11000],
  ["May", 9000]
]);

// create a 3d column chart
chart = anychart.column3d();

// create a column series and set the data
var series = chart.column(data);

// set the container id
chart.container("container");

// initiate drawing the chart
chart.draw();
```

## Z-Angle

3D charts can be shown from different angles of view: to set the angle, use the {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian3d#zAngle}zAngle(){api} method with any 3D chart except the 3D Pie.

**Note:** The value you use as a parameter should fall in the range from 0 to 90. By default, the angle is 45°. 

In the following sample, there is a 3D Column chart with the Z-angle set to 20°.

```
// configure the z-angle of the chart
chart.zAngle(20);
```

<a name='z_aspect'></a>
## Z-Aspect

3D charts can vary in depth: to set it, use the {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian3d#zAspect}zAspect(){api} method with any 3D chart except the 3D Pie.

**Note:** You can set the depth either in pixels (numeric value) or in percentage (string value).

In the sample below, there is a 3D Column chart with the Z-aspect set to 100% (the Z-angle is also configured):

```
// configure the z-aspect of the chart
chart.zAspect("100%"");
```

<a name='z_distribution'></a>
## Z-Distribution

In 3D multi-series charts, series are distributed along the X-axis by defalut. However, you can also distribute them along the Z-axis: call the {api:anychart.charts.Cartesian3d#zDistribution}zDistribution(){api} method and use **"true"** as a parameter. The **"false"** paramater enables the default X-distribution.

Here is a sample 3D Column chart with the Z-axis distribution enabled:

```
// enable the z-axis distribution mode
chart.zDistribution(true);
```
