## Overview

Knowledge about line configuration parameters is very important, because AnyChart allows to configure almost any line you can see on the chart: Lines in charts, grids, tooltips and labels, and even tickmark lines.
  
  
The name of the method is almost always {api:anychart.graphics.vector.Stroke}**stroke()**{api}. All line parameters and features are described in this tutorial.
  
  
You can also refer to the detailed [Stroke API description](../Graphics/Stroke_Settings).

## Basics

Each line can be colored with a solid or gradient fill, you can set line thickness and opacity and use dashed strokes.

Typical line settings look like:

```
  series.stroke("5 red");
```

The sample line chart below shows you the different line settings:

## Coloring

There are two types of line coloring: "Solid" and "Gradient".

### Solid Color

Solid color type is default for any object of Anychart html5 charting library and you don't need to use any special settings to apply Solid color. For more information see [Color Management](Color_Management) article.

```
  series.stroke('red');
```

### Gradient Color

To color a line with a gradient transition you should set color keys, opacity, angle of coloring and stroke thickness.

```
  series.stroke({
    keys: ['.1 red', '.5 blue', '.9 green'],
    thickness: 5
  })
```

## Line Thickness

To change the thickness of a line set thickness through string in pixels before the color and separate it from color with a space:

```
  series.stroke("3 red");
```

This way is not the only one to set stroke thickness. Here is the code with thickness, set through object:

```
  series.stroke({
    color: "red",
    thickness: 5
  })
```

## Dashed Lines

You can make line or grid line dashed and tune dash properties:

```
  series.stroke({color: "yellow", dash: "2 2"});
```

## Line Opacity

To change the opacity of a line use **opacity** attribute. The value is set as a ratio: 1 stands for opaque, and 0 - for transparent line. Opacity may be set though line and through object:

Opacity through line:

```
  series.stroke("red 0.8");
```

Opacity through object:

```
  series.stroke({
    color: "red",
    opacity: 0.8
  });
```

## Change borders

In case you need to change the border of a bar or a column series, you can use the {api:anychart.graphics.vector.Stroke}**stroke()**{api} parameter.

```
  // set first series data
  var column = chart.column(data.mapAs({x: [0], value: [1]}));
  // set stroke thickness 5px and stroke color as red
  column.stroke("5 red");
  // markers settings
  var markers = column.markers();
  // enable markers
  markers.enabled(true);
  // markers color
  markers.fill("red");
  // markers border color
  markers.stroke("red 0.4");
```
