# Legend

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Enabling/Disabling Legend](#enabling/disabling_legend)

## Overview
Legend is a table on a chart listing and explaining the symbols and colors used, usually along with series and/or point data point names and any other additional information that helps user to understand a chart. 
  
  
<!--In AnyChart Legend configuration is all the same for all chart types.-->
You can define where legend should be placed on the chart and even create "floating" legend to save the space.
  
  
In this article all legends features and setting are explained and demonstrated.

## Enabling/Disabling Legend

To enable legend you have to specify **.enable(true)** parameter of **.legend()** method:

```
  // create chart
  var chart = anychart.line();
  
  // enable legend
  chart.legend().enabled(true);
```

## Easy Auto Legend 

By default legend shows all series names with a symbol that shows the color and the type of the series.

To enable such legend in your chart just enable it:

```
  chart.legend().enabled(true);
```

## Title




In this tutorial we will explain in details how to configure background in AnyChart.

Background consists of fill, stroke and border corners. These element are configured using {api:anychart.core.ui.Background#fill}**.fill()**{api}, {api:anychart.core.ui.Background#stroke}**.stroke()**{api} and {api:anychart.core.ui.Background#corners}**.corners()**{api} attributes. Background is used in chart titles, labels, tooltips, chart background, data plot, and many more, and they all are configured the same way.

Below you will find the reference of the most important parameters of the mentioned methods and see the demonstration of theirs settings.

## Stroke

Border is configured using {api:anychart.core.ui.Background#stroke}**.stroke()**{api} parameter. Stroke can be **"Solid"**, **"Dashed"** and **"Gradient"**. If type
 is **"Solid"**, then color is specified using color attribute; to configure **"Gradient"** you have to use gradient keys. Dashed borders have to be set with special keys too.

Sample solid stroke settings:

```
  chart.background().stroke('5 red');
```

Sample gradient stroke settings:

```
  chart.background().stroke({
    keys: ['.1 red', '.5 yellow', '.9 blue'],
    angle: 45,
    thickness: 5
  });
```

Sample dashed stroke settings:

```
    chart.background().stroke({color: 'red', dash: '5 2 5', thickness: 5});
```

On the chart below you can see 3 different border types and a chart without a border.

## Fill

With AnyChart it is possible to color background with a solid color, with a gradient transition or fill it with an image. Fill is configured using {api:anychart.core.ui.Background#fill}**.fill()**{api} method and depending on the type it has different parameters.

### Solid

When fill type is set to "Solid", background is filled with one color and you can control this color opacity. Colors
can be defined with any of the methods described in [Color management tutorial](Color_Management).Sample solid fill:

```
    chart.background().fill('gold');
```

In the sample below a chart, a data plot and a chart title backgrounds are colored with a solid fill:

### Gradient

AnyChart allows to create Gradient fills for any background. There are two types of gradient fills - "Linear" and "Radial". Sample gradient background:

``` 
    chart.background().fill({
        keys: ['.1 lightblue', '.7 blue', '.9 darkblue'],
        angle: -130,
    });
```

The sample below demonstrates how gradient fill can be used to create really attractive area chart.

The same sample, but with radial gradient fill:

### Image

Image fill allows you to set an image as a background. An image can be **stretched**, **tiled** or fit by **proportions**. Supported image formats are JPEG, GIF, PNG. Sample image background:

```
    chart.background().fill({
        src: 'http://static.anychart.com/underwater.jpg',
        mode: acgraph.vector.ImageFillMode.FILL
    });
```

## Corners Settings

You can adjust the shape of borders corners, there are 4 types for corners: **"Square"**, **"Rounded"**, **"Cut"** and **"RoundedInner"**. Appearance of these types is shown on the image below:

![](http://anychart.com/products/anychart/docs/users-guide/img/corners_table.png)

For "Rounded", "Cut" and "RoundedInner" types you can control not only the shape, but also a radius of "rounding" or "cutting" for all corners, or given corners. Sample settings for "rounding" all corners:

```
    chart.background().stroke('3 red')
        .cornerType('round')
        .corners(10);
```

Also, it is possible to choose radius of any corner. Just set four number for every corner in this order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right corner. If a radius set to 0, no effect will be applied. Settings for bottom-right and bottom-left corners:

```
    chart.background().stroke('black')
        .cornerType('cut')
        .corners(0, 0, 5, 5);
```

The dashboard below demonstrates all possible corners types:
