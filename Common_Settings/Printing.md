Printing
======================
Although AnyChart is intended for creation interactive charts for web we provide an opportunity to print any of our charts.

You can print any chart at any time using **.print()** method.

```
  chart.print();  // this method will print your chart
```



Sample below demonstrates chart printing:

{sample}Exports\_02{sample}
