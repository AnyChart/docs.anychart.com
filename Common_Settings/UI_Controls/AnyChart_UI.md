# AnyChart UI

AnyChart UI is a set of utility components that may help you with integration and improve user experience. UI elements are not the part of rendered SVG/VML chart images, they are dynamic HTML elements with JavaScript coded interactivity, and their outlook is controlled by anychart.css.

The following UI components are available and supported:

* [Context Menu](Context_Menu)
* [Preloader](Preloader)

The following UI components are present in the Framework, but are in beta:

* [Gantt Toolbar](Gantt_Toolbar)

In the upcoming releases we plan to add:

* General Toolbar Component
* Stock Drawing Toolbar
* Updated Gantt Toolbar Component
* Export Data/Image Toolbar
* Breadcrumbs for Drill Down Control

**NOTE:** In previous versions [Chart Editor](../../Chart_Editor/Overview) was a part of AnyChart UI, and now it is an [AnyChart Extension](../../Quick_Start/Modules#extensions).
