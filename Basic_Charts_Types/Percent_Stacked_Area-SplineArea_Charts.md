## Overview
Data that is arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in an area chart. Area charts are good at emphasizing the magnitude of changes over time, as well as at drawing attention to the total value across a trend.

100% stacked area charts are multi-series area charts that display the trend of the percentage each value contributes over time or categories.

## Chart

As stacked charts should show percent contribution of different components to the total, we will demonstrate them on sales of an imaginable ACME FastFood, Corp. Let's assume that it sells Ice Creams, Chocolate Bars and Coke all through the year.
  
  
So, we have three series of data - one series for each product. Categories will be seasons:

```
  var dataSet = anychart.data.set([
    ["Winter", 12000, 12000, 10000],
    ["Spring", 13000, 12000, 17000],
    ["Summer", 25000, 15000, 19000],
    ["Autumn", 16000, 16000, 16000]
  ]);
```

Now we have to tell Y-Axis to display these series in a percent stacked mode:

```
  var yScale = chart.yScale();
  yScale.stackMode("percent");
```

And set "Area" as a default series type:

```
  chart = anychart.area();
```

Everything is ready, letâ€™s have a look at our sample of a percent stacked area chart:

{sample}BCT_Percent-Stacked\_Area-SplineArea\_Charts\_01{sample}

## Spline Stacked Area

This type of area chart makes your data look a bit more attractive: points and angles are replaced with a single spline. Just change default series type to {api:anychart.core.cartesian.series.RangeSplineArea}"SplineArea"{api} and get your data displayed in a more appealing way:

```
  chart.splineArea(seriesData_1);
```

<!--Also, let's add area tooltips and make them more informative, to that we will change their format:

XML Syntax
XML Code
Plain code
01
<area_series>
02
  <tooltip_settings enabled="true">
03
    <format><![CDATA[{%SeriesName} - {%Value}$ - {%YPercentOfCategory}{numDecimals:2}%]]></format>
04
  </tooltip_settings>
05
</area_series>-->
Here is a sample of a spline stacked area chart:

{sample}BCT_Percent-Stacked\_Area-SplineArea\_Charts\_02{sample}
<!--
<a name="percent"/>
## Adding "%" to axis labels

If you want to add percent symbol to axis labels - format the axis labels in the following way:

XML Syntax
XML Code
Plain code
01
<axes>
02
  <y_axis>
03
    <labels align="inside">
04
      <format><![CDATA[{%Value}%]]></format>
05
    </labels>
06
    <scale mode="PercentStacked" maximum="100" />
07
  </y_axis>
08
</axes>
Here is a sample stacked area chart with "%" labels, and notice align="inside" in <labels> node - this is an attribute that aligns labels.
