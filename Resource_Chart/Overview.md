## Overview

Resource Chart is a great instrument of planning and resource distribution. It has three basic cases of usage:
<ul>
<li>resource distribution</li>
<li>resource optimization (conflicts resolving)</li>
<li>resource planning</li>
</ul>

Resource Chart is rather similar to a Resource Gantt Chart, the only difference between them is in the appearance. The purposes of a Resource Chart are completely the same as those for a Resource Gantt Chart.

This section is supposed to give all the information about Resource Charts and its adjusting. The very first article we would recommend to visit is [Quick Start](Quick_Start) - this article explains the basic moments about creating a Resource Chart. 

To learn more about data and its adjusting, look through the [Working with Data](Working_With_Data) article. 

Different modes of working with time and adjusting them is described in the [Time Tracking Mode](Time_Tracking_Mode) article.

The [Visual Appearance](Visual_Appearance) tells about fixing colors, fonts and other visual settings.
