## Overview

Resource Chart is a great instrument of planning and resource distribution. It has three basic cases of usage:
<ul>
<li>resource distribution</li>
<li>resource optimization (conflicts resolving)</li>
<li>resource planning</li>
</ul>

 Resource Chart is rather similar to a Resource Gantt Chart, the only difference between them is in the appearance. The purposes of a Resource Chart are completely the same as those for a Resource Gantt Chart.
