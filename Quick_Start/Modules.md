# Modules

## Overview

Modular System is the core of AnyChart 8. It allows you to significantly reduce the size of the JavaScript running on your web page by connecting only those chart types and features that you actually use. The modular based AnyChart is perfectly compatible with popular bundling tools such as Webpack, Browserify, and so on.

### Builder

Custom JavaScript Builder is designed for assembling a JavaScript file that contains only the features and chart types you are really going to use. You can also build a file that contains your [license key](Credits).
