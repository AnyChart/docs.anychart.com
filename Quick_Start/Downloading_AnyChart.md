## Using AnyChart with a CDN
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content\_delivery\_network" target="_blank">CDN</a> can offer a performance benefit by hosting AnyChart on servers spread across the globe. This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your web page has already downloaded a copy of AnyChart from the same CDN, it won't have to be downloaded again.
  
 
To use AnyChart CDN, simply reference the file directly from http://cdn.anychart.com/ in the script tag:
```
<script src="//cdn.anychart.com/js/latest/anychart.min.js"></script>
```
