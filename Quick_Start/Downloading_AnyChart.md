To use AnyChart CDN simply reference the [anychart-bundle.min.js file](//cdn.anychart.com/js/latest/anychart-bundle.min.js) using script tag:

## Production vs Development Builds

Development build contains debug functionality, which may be useful to debug your code in old browser version (IE6 e.g). Also it provides some log information in console, such as misconfiguration warnings. 

Production Build is smaller and more robust, we recommended to use it to get the best performance and deliver the fastest possible user experience to your customers.

## Package Content
Binaries package contains all resources you may need to work with AnyChart:  
* _demos/_ - chart gallery adapted to work offline,
* _js/_ - JavaScript binaries folder,
  * _anychart.min.js_ - production build,
  * _anychart.dev.min.js_ - development build,
* _index.html_ - binaries package index.
