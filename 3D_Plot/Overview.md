# 3D Charts

## Surface Chart

Surface plots are diagrams of three-dimensional data. Rather than showing the individual data points, surface plots show a functional relationship between a designated dependent variable (Y), and two independent variables (X and Z). See [Surface Chart](Surface_Chart) article to learn more.

## Basic 3D Charts

AnyChart supports 3D versions of the following basic chart types: Area, Bar, Column, Line. These charts are "pseudo 3D" which means they are three dimensional only for the purposes of chart decoration and embelishement. Please see [Basic 3D Charts](../Basic_Charts/3D/Overview) to learn more.  

## 3D Pie and Doughnut

AnyChart supports 3D versions of the following basic chart types: Area, Bar, Column, Line. These charts are "pseudo 3D" which means they are three dimensional only for the purposes of  chart decoration and embelishement. Please see [3D Pie Chart](../Basic_Charts/3D/Pie_Chart) and [3D Doughnut Chart](../Basic_Charts/3D/Doughnut_Chart) to learn more.
