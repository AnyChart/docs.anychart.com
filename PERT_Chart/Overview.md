## Overview

PERT is an abbreviation for "Program (Project) Evaluation and Review Technique". This technique, developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, is used in project management to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. It is applied mostly in large-scale projects where time is the major factor and allows to schedule a project without knowing precisely the details and durations of all activities. For example, PERT was used in planning the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble.

## Use cases

While recognizing that, at first sight, Programme Evaluation and -
Review Technique might seem too complicated for general application to
all education programmes in the developing countries, the fact nevertheless
remains that it can be profitably applied in certain circumstances. For
example, the programming of school building projects can usefully be based
on the PERT method! similarly, the organization of examinations on a
national scale, owing to its cost and complexity, is worth basing on a
PERT network^ furthermore, the introduction of a reform or innovation
into a school system should be carefully planned, and simplified versions
of PERT methods will probably prove very valuable in planning the timetable
of operations. One last example of the potential use of PERT methods is
often suggested, namely for the preparation of education plans. 

PERT is based on the theory of graphsj it is expressed in graphic
diagrams in the form of a network of arrows resulting from the analysis
of a programme. These diagrams support the elements used to establish the
calculations. 

PERT events, therefore, unlike activities, consume neither time nor
resources. Furthermore, each event except the first event (or events) and
the last event (or events) are bound to be the beginning and the end of
one or more activities,, Similarly, every activity starts with an event
and ends with an event.
In a sense, therefore, activities constitute a constraint in the
achievement of events, since an event cannot be deemed to be achieved
(or attained) unless the activities which lead to it (or predecessor
activities) are accomplished. The result is constraints between activities
starting from (or successor to) an event and the predecessor activities,(l)
