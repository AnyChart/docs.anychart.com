## Overview

PERT is an abbreviation for "Program (Project) Evaluation and Review Technique". This technique, developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, is used in project management to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. It is applied mostly in large-scale projects where time is the major factor and allows to schedule a project without knowing precisely the details and durations of all activities. For example, PERT was used in planning the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble.

## Use cases

Despite PERT technology might seem too complicated, it can still be profitably applied and used in some circumstances. For example, planning a building project can be successfully based on the PERT method. Similarly, the organization of any examinations or competitions, especially on national scale, due to being complicated and expensive, is worth basing on PERT. Any reforms, innovations or other activities which demands a great time and resource planning are good cases for using PERT. 

PERT is based of the graphs theory. Each activity (task) starts with an event (milestone) and ends with an event.
