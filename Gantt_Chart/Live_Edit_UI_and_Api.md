# Overview
The Live Edit mode allows you to edit any part of your Gannt without touching the code. All you need to do use the cursor to change the duration, position or connectons.

In this article we will consider the "editing mode" of AnyGantts. For simplifying the material, there are two paragraphs for TimeLine and DataGrid. 

# DataGrid

There is a couple of wonderful features we've applied to our DataGrid.
At first, you can change the position and the level of an item. You should only drag the item to a place where you'd like it to be. Look at the picture below.

<img>

However, it's not possible to make a parent item its own child, while you can put that parent item with all its children inside another gantt tree.

Then, our parental items can be expanded and rolled up. Just click once on the "+"/"-" sign or double-click the row with the item.

## TimeLine

Stretch the length
You can change the duration of the period, its start and end time. Hover right or left border, watch when your cursor is of this <img> type and drag it. 

Drag&Drop
Also you can change the start and end date without changing the duration of the task - you can simply drag the timeline of a process to wherever you want. Hover the element, wait for this <img> cursor and drag the timeline.

Change the connectors
If you need to change the connections of some elements, you can do it also by simply dragging the connector point. Again, hover the side border of a timeline, wait till the points will show up and drag the required one to the element you need.

Baseline changing



Readyness
The difference between the behaviour of the process timeline and its baseline is in having readyness. 

Milestones

You cannot change the duration of a milestone as they have no duration, but you still can drag it to another position.

##Scrolling

When you set the connectors, make an end date later or a start date earlier than a gantt screen displays, it will start scrolling automatically. There're no limits for scrolling, so you may set any time you need.
