#Overview

A linear gauge is visual representation of a measuring device with a horizontal or vertical scale and a pointer or multiple pointers indicating particular values. The scale is usually color zoned, which helps to see what range the value of interest falls in. Linear gauges can represent thermometers, radio scales, battery indicators, rulers, and any other devices with straight lineâ€“shaped scales.

A Circular Gauge is a visual representation of a measuring device with a radial axis that sweeps any angle from 0 to 360 degrees and a pointer (Needle or Knob) that indicates values on that scale. Gauge axes are usually colored for easy value distinction. Gauges can be used as clocks, speedometer, compass, volume tuner or any other gauge that should represent the value as an angle on a circle plot.
