#Overview

A gauge is a visual representation of a measuring device with a scale and a pointer or multiple pointers indicating particular values. The scale is usually color zoned, which helps to see what range the value of interest falls in.

In AnyChart, there are two types of gauges, circular and linear. Circular gauges represent devices with circular scales: clocks speedometers, compasses, volume tuners. Linear gauges represent devices with straight line-shaped scales: thermometers, radio scales, battery indicators, rulers.

Both types share many settings, which can be found in the [Basics](Basics) article. However, some of the settings differ as well as the types of pointers used (the only common type is marker). To learn more, see articles in the Circular and Linear folders.
