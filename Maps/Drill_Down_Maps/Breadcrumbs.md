#Breadcrumbs

## Overview

Breadcrumbs help to find the location of the current drill down level. To get the path to the current region, use {api:anychart.charts.TreeMap#getDrilldownPath}getDrilldownPath(){api} method. It returns the levels as objects in order, so it's possible to get some information about the path to your current location. Breadcrumbs can be used to get to any level upper in the path, as they represent all levels, so it makes exploring maps easier and more comfortable.
