## Overview 

Labels in Maps are somewhat similar to the usual labels you can find and configure for any other chart type, with the common differences of keywords and the fact that some data is provided by the map source itself.

To learn about Labels editing in general please visit [Text Settings](../Appearance_Settings/Text_Settings) and [Text Formatters](../Common_Settings/Text_Formatters).
