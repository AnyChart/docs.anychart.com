## Overview

Seat Maps are not Geographical Maps, seat map or seating chart, is a diagram of the seat layout inside a building, passenger aircraft or else. They are often published by airlines for informational purposes, and are of use to passengers for selection of their seat at booking or check-in. AnyMap technology allows to create any kind of seat maps, schemes or interactive layouts.


## Preparing SVG Image

Creating seat maps is made possible by AnyMap ability to load specially formatted SVG Images and using them as the source for maps. How SVG image should be formatted is described in [Custom SVG Maps](Custom_SVG_Maps) article.

If you need to create your own SVG-picture in a graphic editor, look through the [Preparing SVG Image](Preparing_SVG_Image) article.


## Creating Seat Map

When you have a suitable SVG image with assign identifiers you can start developing your own Seat Map. 


### Upload the SVG Data

When your SVG image is ready, we need to upload it to our sample to work with its attributes.

```
```

{sample}Maps\_Seat\_01{sample}

### Map Data

Besides the SVG-image, we need a Map data, which objects are groups of attributes.

## Samples

You can find samples of using SVG images to create Seat Maps in [AnyMap: Seat Maps Gallery](http://www.anychart.com/products/anymap/gallery/Seat_Maps/).
