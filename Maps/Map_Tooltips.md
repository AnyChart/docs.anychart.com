## Overview 

Tooltips in Maps are quite similar to the usual tooltips you can find and configure for any other chart type, the only differences is that you can use keywords provided by the map source.

To learn about Tooltips editing in general please visit [Text Settings](../Appearance_Settings/Text_Settings) and [Text Formatters](..\Common_Settings/Text_Formatters) Tooltips text and formatting tutorial.

## Tooltips for Map regions

When you attach the data to your map, you can add some extra fields which you may want to show later in the tooltip. Just 

In the sample below we've got a map of Australia, where each state has got some extra information which lately can be viewed in tooltips on states hover.
