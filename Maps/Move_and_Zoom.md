Move and Zoom API
=================

AnyChart Maps are JavaScript interactive maps, with ability to change color when you move mouse over the element, when you select them or move mouse over the legend or color range item, they have interactive labels and tooltips, but surely one of the most demanded features of interactive maps is an ability to zoom in/zoom out and move the map to provide end-user with ability to dig into the data represented on the map.

By default maps already have keyboard/mouse zoom in/out and pan features enabled, this can be turned on/off or tuned using {api:anychart.charts.Map#interactivity}interactivity(){api} method.

AnyChart JavaScript Maps provide full set of methods to control map zoom and move: {api:anychart.charts.Map#zoom}zoom(){api}, {api:anychart.charts.Map#zoomTo}zoomTo(){api} {api:anychart.charts.Map#zoomToFeature}zoomToFeature(){api} and {api:anychart.charts.Map#move}move{api}.
