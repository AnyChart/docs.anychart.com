## Overview

As the name implies, symbols (circles), representing the values, are drawn of the proportional size to the size of the value being represented. The size of the bubbles (proportional symbols in maps) is not dependent on the size of the region associated with the variable. For example, if we show the value of unemployment on a proportional symbol map of Europe, Slovenia would have the bigger visual importance then Germany if their unemployment values were so (e.g. 9.3% in Slovenia, 4.7% in Germany).

An example of proportional circles is shown below.

The Bubble series in Maps is quite similar to the Basic Bubble series. The only difference about it is defining the center of each circle. While we can do it only one way in [Cartesian/Scatter](../Basic\_Chart\_Types/Bubble\_Chart) - with the usage of necessary "x" and "value" fields and "size" for the bubbles' sizes, in maps there are two options about doing that. We we look through them in this article.
