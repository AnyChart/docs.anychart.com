## Overview

A map is a reflection of symbolic relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions and themes.

Some of the maps are static, two-dimensional, geometrically or approximately accurate representations of three-dimensional space, 
while others are dynamic or interactive, even three-dimensional. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent 
any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or scale; e.g. brain mapping, DNA mapping and extraterrestrial mapping.

Interactive Maps is a unique feature of AnyChart component that allows you to visualize geographical related data. We use the same swf file to render maps and charts - this allows you to combine maps and chart in the interactive dashboards and easily deploy both of them.

The maps themselves are stored in a separate file with "*.amap" extension, to render a desired map you just place this file and swf file on your server and specify them in XML settings file.
