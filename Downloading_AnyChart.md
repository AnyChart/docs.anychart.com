## Using AnyChart with a CDN

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content\_delivery\_network" target="_blank">CDNs</a> can offer a performance benefit by hosting AnyChart on servers spread across the globe. This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your web page has already downloaded a copy of AnyChart from the same CDN, it won't have to be re-downloaded.  
  
To use AnyChart CDN, simply reference the file directly from http://cdn.anychart.com/ in the script tag:

```
<script>
    <script src="//cdn.anychart.com/js/latest/anychart.min.js"></script>
</script>
```

## Past Releases
Previous versions of AnyChart 7.x can be found and downloaded from <a href="http://cdn.anychart.com/" target="_blank">AnyChart CDN</a>.
