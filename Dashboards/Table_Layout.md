Table layout

## Border

Border is a part of a table. It visually divides whole table into separate cells as well as wraps these cells. As any 
part of chart it can be configured and all settings can be adjusted. In this section there are just several 
demonstration samples. Full information on borders and lines settings can be found in [Strokes and Lines](../General_Appearance_Settings/Strokes_and_Lines) tutorial.
