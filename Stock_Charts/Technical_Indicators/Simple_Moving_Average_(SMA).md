## Overview

A technical indicator is a type of analysis chart that indicates market direction. Indicators generally overlay on price chart data to indicate where the price is going, or whether the price is in an "overbought" condition or an "oversold" condition.

AnyChart Stock Chart Component supports automatic building of several types of technical indicators. Technical indicators are based on data from data providers and do not depend on series.

This document lists available indicator types and gives directions to the tutorials about each indicator type and general information about technical indicators in AnyChart Stock Component.
