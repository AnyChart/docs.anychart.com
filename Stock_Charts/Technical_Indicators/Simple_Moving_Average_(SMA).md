## Overview

An exponential moving average (EMA), sometimes also called an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older data point decreases exponentially, giving much more importance to recent observations while still not discarding older observations entirely.

AnyChart Stock allows you to add EMA with desired period to any of your charts.

Mathematical description of the indicator please see at: [Mathematical Description of Technical Indicators](Mathematical_Description).
