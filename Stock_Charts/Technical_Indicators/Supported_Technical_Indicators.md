We are constantly working on improvements and if you are interested how this list will be expanded - see our [Roadmap](http://www.anychart.com/products/anystock/roadmap/), if indicators you are interested in are not there - please [contact us](http://www.anychart.com/support/) and we will try to figure something out.
