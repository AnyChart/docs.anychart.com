candlestick open or the current Heikin-Ashi candlestick close. 

**HA-High = Maximum of the High(0), HA-Open(0) or HA-Close(0)** 

4. The Heikin-Ashi low is the minimum of three data points: 
the current period's low, the current Heikin-Ashi 
candlestick open or the current Heikin-Ashi candlestick close.

** HA-Low = Minimum of the Low(0), HA-Open(0) or HA-Close(0)**

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical_indicators/obv-zero.png"></center>

## Parabolic SAR

[Parabolic SAR](Parabolic_SAR_\(PSAR\)) is created according to the following algorithm.

At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated ahead of time. That is, tomorrow's SAR value is built using data available today. The general formula used for this is:

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical_indicators/psar.png" width="400"></center>

Where SARi and SARi - 1 represent today's and tomorrow's SAR values, respectively.

The extreme point, EP, is a record kept during each trend that represents the highest value reached by the price during the current up trend - or lowest value during a downtrend. On each period, if a new maximum (or minimum) is observed, the EP is updated with that value.

The &alpha; value represents the acceleration factor. Usually, this is set to a value of 0.02 initially. This factor is increased by 0.02 each time a new EP is recorded.

To keep it from getting too large, a maximum value for the acceleration factor is normally set at 0.20, so that it never goes beyond that.

The SAR is recursively calculated in this manner for each new period. There are, however, two special cases that will modify the SAR value:

* If tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) today's or yesterday's price range, the SAR must be set to the closest price bound. For example, if in an up trend, the new SAR value is calculated and it results to be greater than today's or yesterday's lowest price, the SAR must be set equal to that lower boundary.
* If tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) tomorrow's price range, a new trend direction is then signaled, and the SAR must "switch sides." Upon a trend switch, several things happen. The first SAR value for this new trend is set to the last EP recorded on the previous trend. The EP is then reset accordingly to this period's maximum. The acceleration factor is reset to its initial value.

## Price Channels

## Stochastic Oscillator

[Stochastic Oscillator](Stochastic_Oscillator) indicator has two series, both being calculated with the help of other indicators (EMA or SMA). Also it has 3 types: Fast Stochastic Oscillator, Slow Stochastic Oscillator and Full Stochastic Oscillator.

The defaults create a Fast Stochastic Oscillator indicator.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fastK.png"></center>

where pK is the first period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the %K value.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fastD.png"></center>

where p3 is the third period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the %D value.

While Fast Stochastic Oscillator is used for signals, the Slow Stochastic Oscillator is supposed to reflect this emphasis. 

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/slowK.png"></center>

where 3 is a default period for getting slow K.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/slowD.png"></center>

where 3 is a default period for getting slow D.

The Full Stochastic Oscillator is a fully customizable version of the Slow Stochastic Oscillator. Users can set the look-back period, the number of periods to slow %K and the number of periods for the %D moving average. 

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fullK.png"></center>
