## Overview

This document contains mathematical description of all technical indicators available in AnyChart Stock Component.

For all formulas and indicators below:
<ul>
	<li><strong>n</strong> is a period for which calculations are done, it is usually set by the <strong>period</strong> parameter of the 
	method that creates an indicator.</li>
	<li><strong>X<sub>i</sub></strong> is the value passed by the data source.</li>
</ul>

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/sma.png"></center>

## Stochastic Oscillator

[Stochastic Oscillator](Stochastic_Oscillator) indicator has two series, both being calculated with the help of other indicators (EMA or SMA). Also it has 3 types: Fast Stochastic Oscillator, Slow Stochastic Oscillator and Full Stochastic Oscillator.

The defaults create a Fast Stochastic Oscillator indicator.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fastK.png"></center>

where pK is the first period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the %K value.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fastD.png"></center>

where p3 is the third period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the %D value.

While Fast Stochastic Oscillator is used for signals, the Slow Stochastic Oscillator is supposed to reflect this emphasis. 

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/slowK.png"></center>

where 3 is a default period for getting slow K.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/slowD.png"></center>

where 3 is a default period for getting slow D.

The Full Stochastic Oscillator is a fully customizable version of the Slow Stochastic Oscillator. Users can set the look-back period, the number of periods to slow %K and the number of periods for the %D moving average. 

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fullK.png"></center>

where p2 is the second period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the smoothed %K value.

<center><img src="https://static.anychart.com/images/technical\_indicators/fullD.png"></center>

where p3 is the third period that is set through the {api:anychart.core.stock.Plot#stochastic}stochastic(){api} method, which is a period for the %D value.

## TRIX
