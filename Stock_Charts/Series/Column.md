## Overview

Column series is a standard series that uses columns to show the values of a parameter changing through time or to show the difference between values of similar subjects in some area. For example, column charts are widely used in meteorology, economics, etc. - everything that is or might be connected with statistics is suitable for using column series. You can find all information about creating a standard column chart in the [Column Chart article](../Basic_Chart_Types/Column_Chart).
