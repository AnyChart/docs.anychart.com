Series type
========

Our stocks has a method allowing to change the series type at once if the current series and the replacing one have the same or similar fields. Look up the [Series Type](Series_Type) and [series types table](Supported_Series#list_of_supported_series) to be sure it's possible to switch those series you need.

To switch the series use *seriesType()* method of a series.
