<!-->Stock Chart is widely spread type of charts that can quite effectively visualize great amount of data. Stock Chart has lots of interesting features such as series zooming, using date scale, etc. Moreover, stock charts are very useful for real-time data visualization.<-->


Stocks are one of the most popular financial instruments in the world. They are usually used in cases with enormous amount of data spreads along the time; so it's quite logical to use them, for example, for showing the company assets and earnings for its whole working period.
That's why stocks are this popular: it can show large amounts of data and keep it clear to the audience.

<br>
Stocks are so special because of two main features:
<ul>1. Data grouping</ul>
	<p style="text-indent: 25px;">This feature is what lets showing those loads of information on one chart at a time. If your data contains more than 500 points in the time interval shown on a chart, AnyStock Charts will automatically group them in a plenty of structures by some parameter. 
	For example, if you've got data which shows daily changing of something for ten years, it means that you've got 3650 data points. To make this information understandable, our stock can group monthly, so we'll have only 120 points on a chart. But what to do if you need to see the values for a couple of days? That's where we go to the second AnyStock feature.</p>
<ul>2. Navigation through the data.</ul> 
	<p style="text-indent: 25px;">If you are not satisfied with having the generalized data shown on a chart, you can use a scrollbar in the bottom of the chart to bring the data to more detailed form. That's how it works.</p>

<br>
Also stocks are able to be adjusted to show some real-time data, as they support streaming. 

<br>
Note that Stock charts have an only X-axis of datetime type.
