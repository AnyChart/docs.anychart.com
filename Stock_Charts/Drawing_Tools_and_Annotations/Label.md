## Overview

Label annotations are created to add text annotations to the chart. You can add any text of your choice and even have some nice features that can make adding annotations easier. 

This type of annotations will be added to [AnyStock](../Overview) in the [next update](https://www.anychart.com/products/anystock/roadmap/).

## Hardcoding

Coming soon.

## Visual Settings

Coming soon.
