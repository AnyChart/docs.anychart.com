## Overview

An indicator used by technical traders to identify periods in which the price of an asset will experience a significant amount of movement. This charting technique consists of a series of vertical lines that correspond to the sequence of numbers known as Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.). Once a trader chooses a starting position (most commonly following a major move) on the chart, a vertical line is placed on every subsequent day that corresponds to the position in the Fibonacci number sequence.
