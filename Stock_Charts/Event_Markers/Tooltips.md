# Event Marker Tooltips

## Overview

Event Markers are very helpful elements of the chart, as they allow showing user explicitly an event that took place at a specific moment of time. Tooltip is an important part of Event markers, it shows detailed information when user moves the mouse over the event marker.

AnyChart Stock charts provide two ways to show tooltips for event markers: Built-in Tooltips and custom HTML tooltips.

## Built-in Tooltips

Built-in tooltips work as all other tooltips in AnyChart, learn the basics in [Tooltip](../../Common_Settings/Tooltip) article and see how it works with Event Markers:

## Custom HTML Tooltips

External tooltips are custom HTML elements that can be created and tuned to your taste. They are created by the means of HTML/CSS and [Events](Events) mechanism.
