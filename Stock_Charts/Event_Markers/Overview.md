Event Markers are very helpful elements of the chart, as they allow showing user explicitly an event that took place at a specific moment of time.

AnyChart Stock has a very flexible and convenient set of tools for working with event markers. Here is a brief list of what it can do:

- Rich interactivity makes the perception of events more convenient to user.
- Selecting event marker by user.
- Grouping into stacks or into a single marker when several markers hit same date.
- Complete control over all visual settings.
- Binding any data to each event marker.
- Built-in elegant tooltip with support for HTML formatting of text.
- Full range of supported external events and methods for controlling event markers from the outside.
- And much more...
