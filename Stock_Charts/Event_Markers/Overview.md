# Event Markers

## Overview

Event markers are very helpful elements of the chart, as they allow showing user explicitly an event that took place at a specific moment of time.

AnyChart Stock has a very flexible and convenient set of tools for working with event markers. Here is a brief list of what it can do:

- Rich interactivity makes the perception of events more convenient,
- Selecting event marker feature,
- Grouping into stacks or into a single marker when several markers hit same date,
- Complete control over all visual settings,
- Binding any data to each event marker,
- Full range of supported external events and methods for controlling event markers from the outside,
- And much more...

## Sample

Here is a basic sample of a chart with event markers:
