## Overview

AnyStocks don't work with all basic series but with Line, Column and OHLC. In this article we will consider using those series in Stocks and Stocks' scroller.

## Stock series

As we have already said, we cannot use all series in Stocks. Only Line, Column and OHLC series work with Stock charts, and all of them have no hover or selected states, only normal one. Let's create a sample with all these series shown on one Stock chart.

```

```

## Stock scroller series

In case of adding the thumbnail series to the scroller, you should know that those series have the "selected" state. Let's add a background series of column type to the scroll bar background and adjust its "selected" state colors.
