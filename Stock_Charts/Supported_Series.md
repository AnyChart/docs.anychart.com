## Overview

AnyStocks don't work with all basic series but with Line, Column and OHLC. In this article we will consider using those series in Stocks and Stocks' scroller.

## Stock series

As we have already said, we cannot use all series in Stocks. Only Line, Column and OHLC series work with stock charts, and all of them have no hover and selected states, only normal one.




## Stock scroller series

In case of adding the thumbnail series to the scroller, you should know that those series have the "selected" state

эти урезаны в сравнении с обычными - нет состояний хавер, селектед, только нормал

у серий на скроллере - есть селектед*
