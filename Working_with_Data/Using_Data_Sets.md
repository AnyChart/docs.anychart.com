Using Data Sets
===============

###Why we need Data Sets?
Fairly often, you need to use a same set of values in the different series of the one chart or different charts at all.
For instance, we have data about weather in a three cities for a same date and we want to see difference on the line chart.
```
       Date      New York   San Francisco   Los Angeles  
   | 2014/6/25 |    28    |      23       |     28      |
   | 2014/6/26 |    26    |      21       |     26      |
   | 2014/6/27 |    27    |      19       |     26      |
   | 2014/6/28 |    25    |      21       |     27      |
   | 2014/6/29 |    29    |      22       |     28      |
   | 2014/6/30 |    28    |      25       |     27      |
```

Usually you divide your data on three pars and create line chart with tree series.
```
       Date      New York        Date      San Francisco        Date      Los Angeles 
   | 2014/6/25 |    28    |  | 2014/6/25 |      23       |  | 2014/6/25 |     28      |
   | 2014/6/26 |    26    |  | 2014/6/26 |      21       |  | 2014/6/26 |     26      |
   | 2014/6/27 |    27    |  | 2014/6/27 |      19       |  | 2014/6/27 |     26      |
   | 2014/6/28 |    25    |  | 2014/6/28 |      21       |  | 2014/6/28 |     27      |
   | 2014/6/29 |    29    |  | 2014/6/29 |      22       |  | 2014/6/29 |     28      |
   | 2014/6/30 |    28    |  | 2014/6/30 |      25       |  | 2014/6/30 |     27      | 
```
In case where you have simple visualization, it is not so difficult. 
But then you start to create something complex, it's became very annoying, 
especially then you need to append, update or remove some data for all dates.
  
To avoid this, we recommend to use Data Sets.
