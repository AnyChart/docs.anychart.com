## Overview

Tree Data is one of the ways to structure data. Tree structure is quite useful way of implementing data which assume
tree like hierarchy with parent/child division. Such structure visualize data nodes connections thus
simplifies data adjusting and improve data organization.

## Usage

The most common case of using data tree is data grid. Data grid represents hierarchy of data. Here is a sample
representing data division.
